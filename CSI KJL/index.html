<h2><u>Education</u></h2>
<p>The University of Georgia is where I attend college. I am pursuing a Management Information Systems degree in the Terry College of Business. I enjoy
going to school there.The city is beautiful and the football team is very good.UGA is the perfect place to enhance your learning and make alot of cool 
new friends from around the world. I participate in the society of information systems club and it is very fun.All of the oppurutnities and rigirous 
cirrculum that UGA has to offer will shape you into a stronger student. It helps build character.
</p> 
<h3><u>Hobbies</u></h3>
<p>Reading is one of my favorite things to do. I also love to learn about techonology and how it can improve to help the world.
If it is very nice outside I like to go running and explore all of the places that are around me. A nice jog observing the sunrise
is a great start to my day. Running around the UGA campus and reading books outside help me focus and enjoy the little tings 
around me. I also enjoy making music. As I listen to the atmosphere around me it keeps me at peace and helps me develop melodic sounds that I 
record to later on after I finish my work.
