<h2><u>Education</u></h2>
<p>The University of Georgia is where I attend college. I am pursuing a Management Information Systems degree in the Terry College of Business. I enjoy
going to school here. The city is beautiful and the football team is very good.  
</p> 
<h3><u>Hobbies</u></h3>
<p>Reading is one of my favorite things to do. I also love to learn about techonology and how it can improve to help the world.
If it is very nice outside I like to go running and explore all of the places that are around me. A nice jog observing the sunrise
is a great start to my day.
